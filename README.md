# Making Postgres Databases for fun and storage

Postgres is such a neat database, everybody wants one.

But you don't want to end up with a mad mess of databases
everywhere. Instead, you can build some centralization of your
databases with this tool.

It runs a single Postgresql server and provides an HTTP API for
creating databases on that server.

Consumers must be registered with the database in some sort of keepie.
